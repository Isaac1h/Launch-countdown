# Frontend Mentor - Blog preview card

A social links profile was developed in HTML and CSS as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge. The provided design, available in both mobile and desktop versions, was used as a reference along with all necessary assets such as images, fonts, and the style guide. The HTML structure was carefully organized, and each section of the project was styled to stay faithful to the design while incorporating personal adjustments.
